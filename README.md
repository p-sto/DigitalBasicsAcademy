## What's inside?
Idea behind this repository is to collect in one place all valuable information more or less related to digital circuit design topic. 
I was heavily inspired by legendary repo by [John Washman](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/blob/master/README.md) dedicated to software engineers.

I treat this repo as an collection of knowledge which interests me the most - throught last few years I have collected singificant number of materials related 
to both analog and digital electronics and now I would like review them and keep in one place.
